# Introduction

(Consumer Product goods)CPG organizations in the processed food industry must monitor crop growth to plan their supply chain for production requirements. Doing a land survey for thousands of farms is both costly and time-consuming, hence, with the emergence of geo-spatial analytics, multiple use cases for crop growth, emissions, and disease tracking have emerged. Solving earth observation problems using satellites are both scalable and cost-effective. In our experience, organizations that procure large amounts of agricultural products and crops ( like corn, potato or coffee) leverage these solutions to avoid supply time shocks and achieve process efficiencies.
